# System-Analysis-and-Design

#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
I was part of a small consulting company that designs systems for various clients. I was assigned to a company named DriverPass whose goal was to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better preapre them for driving tests. 

#What did you do particularly well?
I believe I excelled in identifying and determining functional and nonfunctional requirements for DriverPass' system. I also quickly learned how to create various UML diagrams which were a key component to a successful BRD and SDD.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise my UML class diagram. I felt that I had an adequate understanding of the classes and their associations within the system, however, I believe I could refine class attributes, add class methods, and refine certain assocations/add or remove classes.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Firstly, I reviewed the transcript between my project lead and DriverPass. I was able to determine the major use cases DriverPass was looking to achieve and I turned those use cases into functional requirements. Secondly, I determined nonfunctional requirements and the rest of the BRD sections by combining industry standard practices and specific elements which would contribute to DriverPass' needs and the success of the system. It's of extreme importance to always consider the user's needs as they are the ones who will actually be utilizng the system. It wouldn't make sense to design and implement a system that's not tailored to the user's specific needs and wants.

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would appropach future systems by collecting pertinent information about the business and its processes. Using requirement collection techniques such as group discussions, interviews, or surveys can help uncover certain elements of businesses while allowing me to determine the overall goal and objective of the system. Furthermore, using non-coding techniques such as UML diagrams in conjunction with BRD's and SDD's to assist in organizing my research is key to maintianing a neat and efficient design process.
